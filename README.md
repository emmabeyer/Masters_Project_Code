Project Title: Characterizing the Extent of Harassment and Illegal Feeding of Bottlenose Dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in Icacos and Palominos Cays, Fajardo, Puerto Rico

Project Abstract: Since 2017, social media videos recorded near Icacos and Palominos Cays in Puerto Rico have shown common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) displaying aggressive behaviors towards swimmers, alongside reports of illegal feeding during ecotours. These interactions pose a considerable risk to dolphins and a significant safety concern for humans. This study used a multi-faceted approach that included land- and vessel-based surveys around Icacos and Palominos Cays, social media video compilation and analysis, and a community survey to characterize the extent of bottlenose dolphin harassment activities and illegal feeding around Fajardo. There were no sightings of dolphins during the land- and vessel-based surveys, but the social media analysis showed an increase in overall human-dolphin interactions from 2017 to 2024. In particular there was an increase in aggressive dolphin behavior and dolphins remaining within an armâ€™s length of swimmers. This information will assist in informing future management and outreach efforts aimed at reducing harassment activities and promoting safe and sustainable interactions between humans and bottlenose dolphins within the Fajardo area.

Raw code for the vessel surveys (Boat_Log), land-surveys (Land_Survey), and social media compilation (Social_Media_Data) is included with metadata (SM_Metadata) for the social media data.
